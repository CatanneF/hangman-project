# HANGMAN GAME

## Description:
In each game, a player must figure out the mystery word within 6 guesses. 
Each try, the player is prompted to enter a letter. If correct, the letter appears in the correct placement in the word. If wrong, a part of the hangman appears. The player coninues guessing letters until either all the letters in the word are placed, winning the game, or if the player runs out of tries. 


## Gameplay:
To start the game, open your Terminal and run `node .`
To end the game, press `Ctrl + c`
When prompted, the player should guess a letter. 
If correct, the letter will replace the appropriate letter blank.
If incorrect, the player will lose a turn and a part of the hangman will appear. 

If the player makes a wrong guess 6 times, the full hangman will appear and they have lost the game. 
Conversely, the player will win the game if they guess all the letters in the word.
